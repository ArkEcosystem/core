/*
Test summary :
We want to test that the multisig transactions work as expected.

Workflow :
- step 0 : we just pick from genesis wallet what we need for our test, sending it to a new wallet
- step 1 : we create and send the multisig registration transaction
- step 2 : we check that the registration transaction was forged
- step 3 : we create and send the multisigned transactions
- step 4 : we check that valid multisigned transactions were forged and invalid were not
