/**
 * Actual types which are relevant to queries issued to our GraphQL endpoint.
 * The basic ones are Block, Wallet and Transaction. They each have specific
 * properties and are representative of how they are stored in the Blockchain.
 * For example, a Block type has an array of transactions [Transaction], and
 * Transaction itself is a type which has sender and recipiet Wallet types.
 * Same principles apply to Wallet types, there is interoperability between
 * the defined types of this schema.
