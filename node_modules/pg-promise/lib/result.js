 * **Query Result Mask**
 *
 * Binary mask that represents the result expected from queries.
 * It is used by the base {@link Database#query query} method, as well as method {@link Database#func func}.
 *
 * The mask is always the last optional parameter, which defaults to `queryResult.any`.
 *
 * Any combination of flags is supported, except for `one + many`.
 *
 * The type is available from the library's root: `pgp.queryResult`.
 *
 * @see {@link Database#query Database.query}, {@link Database#func Database.func}
