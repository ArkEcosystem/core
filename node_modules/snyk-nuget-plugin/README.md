Snyk helps you find, fix and monitor for known vulnerabilities in your dependencies, both on an ad hoc basis and as part of your CI (Build) system.

## Snyk NuGet CLI Plugin

The plugin provides dependency metadata for NuGet projects that manifest dependencies in `project.json`, `packages.config` or `project.assets.json` files.
