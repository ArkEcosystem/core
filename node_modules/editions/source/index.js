/**
 * Edition entries must conform to the following specification.

 * @property {string} description Use this property to decribe the edition in human readable terms. Such as what it does and who it is for. It is used to reference the edition in user facing reporting, such as error messages. E.g. `esnext source code with require for modules`.
 * @property {string} directory The location to where this directory is located. It should be a relative path from the `package.json` file. E.g. `source`.
 * @property {string} entry The default entry location for this edition, relative to the edition's directory. E.g. `index.js`.
 * @property {Array<string>} [tags] Any keywords you wish to associate to the edition. Useful for various ecosystem tooling, such as automatic ESNext lint configuration if the `esnext` tag is present in the source edition tags. Consumers also make use of this via {@link EDITIONS_TAG_BLACKLIST} for preventing loading editions that contain a blacklisted tag. Previously this field was named `syntaxes`. E.g. `["javascript", "esnext", "require"]`.
 * @property {false|Object.<string, string|boolean>} engines This field is used to specific which Node.js and Browser environments this edition supports. If `false` this edition does not support either. If `node` is a string, it should be a semver range of node.js versions that the edition targets. If `browsers` is a string, it should be a [browserlist](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist) value of the specific browser values the edition targets. If `node` or `browsers` is true, it indicates that this edition is compatible with those environments.
 * @example
 * {
 *   "description": "esnext source code with require for modules",
 *   "directory": "source",
 *   "entry": "index.js",
 *   "tags": [
 *     "javascript",
 *     "esnext",
 *     "require"
 *   ],
 *   "engines": {
 *     "node": ">=6",
 *     "browsers": "defaults"
 *   }
 * }

/**
 * These are the various options that you can use to customise the behaviour of certain methods.
 * @typedef {Object} Options
 * @property {Function} require The require method of the calling module, used to ensure require paths remain correct.
 * @property {string} [packagePath] If provided, this is used for debugging.
 * @property {boolean} [verbose] If provided, any error loading an edition will be logged. By default, errors are only logged if all editions failed. If not provided, process.env.EDITIONS_VERBOSE is used.
 * @property {boolean} [strict] If `true`, then only exact version matches will be loaded. If `false`, then likely matches using {@link simplifyRange} will be evaluated, with a fallback to the last. If missing, then `true` is attempted first and if no result, then `false` is attempted.
 * @property {string} [cwd] If provided, this will be the cwd for entries.
 * @property {string} [entry] If provided, should be a relative path to the entry point of the edition.
 * @property {string} [package] If provided, should be the name of the package that we are loading the editions for.
 * @property {stream.Writable} [stderr] If not provided, will use process.stderr instead. It is the stream that verbose errors are logged to.
