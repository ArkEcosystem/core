# snyk-resolve

Finds the filename for a given package name and starting directory. This is used to resolve packages in situations like npm@3 and deduped packages.

Supports both async (via promises) and sync methods of looking up.

## Usage

```js
var resolve = require('snyk-resolve');

// async (promise based)
resolve('foo', process.cwd()).then(function (dir) {
  // assuming that `foo` lived in the root of your drive
  console.assert(dir === '/node_modules/foo');
});

// sync
var dir = resolve.sync('bar', process.cwd());
// throws Error('package not found bar')
```

See tests for more examples.

## Supports

- npm@2 directory structure
- npm@3 directory structure
