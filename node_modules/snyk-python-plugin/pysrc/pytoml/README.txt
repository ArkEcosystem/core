This is pytoml v0.1.16, taken from the avakar/pytoml GitHub repo.

See: https://github.com/avakar/pytoml/releases/tag/v0.1.16

It is bundled out of necessity due to constraints of the
Snyk CLI plugin architecture.

Also, it contains a Snyk-specific patch: the user-configurable "translate"
function now also takes a fourth argument, "pos".
