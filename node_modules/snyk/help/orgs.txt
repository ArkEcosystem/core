Organizations:

To test or monitor your project for a specific org, you can add an optional
flag to the `test`, `monitor` and `wizard` commands:

  $ snyk monitor --org=<my-org>
  Captured a snapshot of this project's dependencies.
  Explore this snapshot at https://snyk.io/org/my-org/monitor/c21bf27d-47f3
  Notifications about newly disclosed vulnerabilities
  related to these dependencies will be emailed to you.

If you have multiple organizations, you can set a default from the CLI using:

  $ snyk config set org=<my-default-org>

Setting a default will ensure all newly monitored projects will be created
under your default organization. If you need to override the default, you can
use the `--org=<other-org>` argument.
