Snyk helps you find, fix and monitor for known vulnerabilities in your dependencies, both on an ad hoc basis and as part of your CI (Build) system.

## Snyk Golang CLI Plugin

This plugin provides dependency metadata for Golang projects that use `dep` (and have a `Gopkg.lock` file), or `govendor` (and have a `vendor/vendor.json` file).
