# Migration Guide
This guide is intended to help with upgrading major versions of the Node Agent.
This information can also be found on [our documentation website][upgrade-doc].

## Upgrading to Agent v5

### Breaking Changes

**Removed deprecated API methods**: The following API methods had been marked as
deprecated since agent v2, and have now been fully removed from the codebase:

* `newrelic.addCustomParameter()`

  Replace with `newrelic.addCustomAttribute()`.

* `newrelic.addCustomParameters()`

  Replace with `newrelic.addCustomAttributes()`.

* `newrelic.createWebTransaction()`

  Replace with `newrelic.startWebTransaction()` and `newrelic.getTransaction()`.

* `newrelic.createBackgroundTransaction()`

  Replace with `newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction()` and `newrelic.getTransaction()`.

* `newrelic.createTracer()`

  Replace with `newrelic.startSegment()`.

**Removed `ignore_server_configuration` setting**: This setting was only implemented
by the Node agent, so removing it improves parity with other language agents.

**Removed `node-cassandra-cql` instrumentation**: This [library][node-cassandra-cql]
has not been updated in 5 years, and has since been superseded by
[cassandra-driver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cassandra-driver), which is
supported by the agent.

**Removed deprecated configuration settings**: The following configuration
settings have been deprecated since agent v3, and have now been removed from the
codebase:

* `capture_params`

  Replaced with `attributes.enabled`. By default, request attributes are not
  sent to New Relic. Set `attributes.enabled: true` to include agent-defined or
  custom attributes in traces.

* `ignored_params`

  Replaced with `attributes.exclude`. Add any request attribute keys to the
  `attributes.exclude` list. Now, instead of having to be an exact match,
  wildcards (`*`) may be appended to each item for broader filtering.

**Updated custom metric naming**: Custom metrics are now prefixed with `Custom/`.
Existing insights queries may need to be addressed moving forward.

### Node Version Support

The agent now only supports Node version 6 and above, which brings it up to date
with Node's [LTS][node-lts-schedule] schedule. Customers running Node 4.x or 5.x
will need to upgrade to a supported version of Node or remain on the v4 agent.

### Released Feature Flags
* `custom_instrumentation`: This feature is no longer configurable.
* `custom_metrics`: This feature is no longer configurable.
* `synthetics`: This feature is no longer configurable.
* `native_metrics`: This feature is now controlled by the
  `plugins.native_metrics.enabled` configuration value.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Upgrading to Agent v4

### Breaking Changes

**Upgraded https-proxy-agent from v0 to v2**: This dependency has been updated
due to a security issue in the version of `https-proxy-agent` the New Relic Node.js
agent used. `https-proxy` v2 is incompatible with node v0.10 and v0.12,
requiring deprecation of those versions for the agent. There is no required
action to migrate from v3 to v4 of New Relic's Node.js agent.

### Node Version Support
The earliest version of Node supported by the v4 agent is 4. Node 0.10 and 0.12,
which have not been updated since February of 2017, are not supported by v4.
Customers running Node 0.10 or 0.12 will need to upgrade to a supported version
of Node or remain on the v3 agent.

[Node 4 is also no longer receiving updates][node-lts-schedule], but we will
continue to support this version of Node for the time being. We highly recommend
moving to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of
the New Relic Node Agent will likely remove support for it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Upgrading to Agent v3

### Breaking Changes

**Removed SSL configuration**: The agent will always connect to New Relic
servers using TLS to encrypt communications. The `ssl` configuration value and
`NEW_RELIC_USE_SSL` environment value are ignored. If set to any value other
than `true`, a warning is logged and the value is ignored.

**Request parameters now prefixed with `request.parameters.`**: Any request
parameters, such as route (`/user/:userId`) or query (`/user?userId=123`)
parameters will now be prefixed with `request.parameters.` when collected. For
example, the route parameter from `/user/:userId` would be collected as
`request.parameters.userId`.

Any Insights dashboards, Alerts, or other NRQL queries using these attributes
must be updated to look for the new attributes instead.

### Released Feature Flags

* `send_request_uri_attribute`: This feature is no longer configurable.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Upgrading to Agent v2

### Breaking Changes

**Reversed naming and ignore rules**: Previously, rules defined in the config
properties `rules.name` and `rules.ignore` were applied in reverse order, the
first rule in the list was applied last. Agent v2 now applies rules in the
order they are defined, so the first rule in the list is applied first.

Users of naming rules in the v1 agent will need to reverse the order of their
rules in the configuration if they're noticing any issues.

**De-duplicated HTTP request transactions**: The v1 agent starts a new
transaction for each _listener_ on an HTTP server's `request` event. In
applications with multiple listeners on the `request` event this would result
in extraneous transactions being created that almost always did not get named
correctly. In v2 the agent only creates a single transaction for each `request`
event emitted.

Any users who utilized multiple `request` event listeners and added a call to
`newrelic.ignoreTransaction()` to remove the extra transactions should remove
those calls.

**Stopped swallowing outbound request errors**: In v1 the Node Agent swallows
unhandled `error` events emitted by outbound HTTP request objects. Agent v2
removed this behavior in favor of not changing normal Node execution, meaning
the `error` event will always be emitted.

If you are making outbound requests and currently do not listen for the `error`
event, add a listener and handle the error as appropriate for your application.

### Updated configuration options

In `newrelic.js`, edit the configuration properties you use for compatibility
with the latest versions:

* `capture_params`

  Replaced with `attributes.enabled`. By default, request attributes are not
  sent to New Relic. Set `attributes.enabled`: true to include agent-defined or
  custom attributes in traces.

* `ignored_params`

  Replaced with `attributes.exclude`. Add any request attribute keys to the
  `attributes.exclude` list. Now, instead of having to be an exact match,
  wildcards (`*`) may be appended to each item for broader filtering.

**NOTE**: The new properties also have overrides for specific destinations
(`transaction_tracer`, `transaction_events`, `error_collector`, and
`browser_monitoring`). For example, setting
`transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled: false`, would restrict attributes from
being collected in transaction traces, while still allowing them for all others,
assuming the root `attributes.enabled` is `true`. Please see
[Node.js agent configuration](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/nodejs-agent-configuration)
for more details.

### Deprecated API Methods
These methods have been marked as deprecated in Agent v2 and will be removed in
v3.

* `newrelic.createWebTransaction()`

  Replace with `newrelic.startWebTransaction()` and `newrelic.getTransaction()`.

* `newrelic.createBackgroundTransaction()`

  Replace with `newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction()` and `newrelic.getTransaction()`.

* `newrelic.addCustomParameter()`

  Replace with `newrelic.addCustomAttribute()`.

* `newrelic.addCustomParameters()`

  Replace with `newrelic.addCustomAttributes()`.

### New API Methods

* [`newrelic.getTransaction()`](https://newrelic.github.io/node-newrelic/docs/API.html#getTransaction)

  This method gets a reference to the currently running transaction. It should
  be used in conjunction with `newrelic.startWebTransaction`,
  `newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction`, or with callback-based message
  consumer services. See our [Trouble Shooting][messaging-troubleshooting-doc]
  documentation for more information on its usage.

* [`newrelic.startWebTransaction()`](https://newrelic.github.io/node-newrelic/docs/API.html#startWebTransaction)
  [`newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction()`](https://newrelic.github.io/node-newrelic/docs/API.html#startBackgroundTransaction)

  These new API methods replace the older `create*Transaction` methods. They
  are easier to use and seamlessly work with promises. Note that unlike the old
  method, the provided callback is invoked immediately.

* [`newrelic.instrument()`](https://newrelic.github.io/node-newrelic/docs/API.html#instrument)
  [`newrelic.instrumentDatastore()`](https://newrelic.github.io/node-newrelic/docs/API.html#instrumentDatastore)
  [`newrelic.instrumentWebframework()`](https://newrelic.github.io/node-newrelic/docs/API.html#instrumentWebframework)
  [`newrelic.instrumentMessages()`](https://newrelic.github.io/node-newrelic/docs/API.html#instrumentMessages)

  These methods can be used to add custom instrumentation for 3rd party modules,
  including those already instrumented by the Node Agent. See our
  [instrumentation tutorials][instrumentation-tutorial] for more information
  on using these methods.

* `newrelic.addCustomAttribute()`

  Use this method to add a custom trace attribute.

* `newrelic.addCustomAttributes()`

  Use this method to add multiple custom trace attributes.

### Node Version Support
The earliest version of Node supported by the v2 agent is 0.10. Node 0.8, which
has not been updated since July of 2014, is not supported by v2. Customers
running Node 0.8 will need to upgrade to a supported version of Node or remain
on the v1 agent. [Node 0.10 is also no longer receiving updates][node-lts-schedule],
but we will continue to support this version of Node for the time being. We
highly recommend moving to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The
next major version of the New Relic Node Agent will likely remove support for
it.

### npm Version Support
The agent now requires npm version 2.0.0 or higher. This version of npm comes
packaged with Node 0.10.44 or higher. If you are using an earlier version of
Node 0.10 you will need to first install npm 2.0.0 or higher or upgrade to a
newer version of Node. Version 2 of npm can be installed with:

```sh
$ npm install --global npm@2
```

### Released Feature Flags
* `express_segments`: This feature is no longer configurable.
* `cat`: This feature is now controlled by the `cross_application_tracer.enabled`
  configuration value.
