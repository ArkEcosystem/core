# @hapi/iron

#### Encapsulated tokens (encrypted and mac'ed objects).

**iron** is part of the **hapi** ecosystem and was designed to work seamlessly with the [hapi web framework](https://hapi.dev) and its other components (but works great on its own or with other frameworks). If you are using a different web framework and find this module useful, check out [hapi](https://hapi.dev) â€“ they work even better together.
